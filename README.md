- Hello! My name is Lizbeth A. (@LizTheJelly)
- This GitHub contains all the projects I (and my other incredible team members) made. Feel free to explore and check out anything that interests you. I'd like to remind you that you should not claim these projects as your own. If you feel the need to reclaim my works as your own, take a mental break and believe that you can create your own game! If you do not believe in yourself, then I believe in you. :)

- I’m interested in game design, storytelling, and a bit of programming.
- Currently earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Game Science.
