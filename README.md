- Hello! My name is Lizbeth A. (@LizTheJelly)
- This Github contains all projects I (and my other incredible team members) made. Feel free to explore and check out anything that interests you.
- Most importantly, do not claim these projects as your own. If you feel the need to reclaim my works as your own, take a mental break and believe
- in yourself that you can create your own game! If you do not believe in yourself, then I believe in you. :)
-
- I’m interested in video games and game designs
- I’m currently learning computer game science
